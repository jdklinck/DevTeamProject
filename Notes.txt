Developers have names 
and ID numbers;
we need to be able to identify one developer without mistaking them for another. 

We also need to know whether or not they have access to the online learning tool: Pluralsight.

Challenge: Our HR Department uses the software monthly to get a list of all our Developers that need a Pluralsight license.
Create this functionality in the Console Application

Our managers need to be able to add and remove members to/from a team by their unique identifier. 
They should be able to see a list of existing developers to choose from and add to existing teams.
Odds are, the manager will create a team,
and then add Developers individually from the Developer Directory to that team.
